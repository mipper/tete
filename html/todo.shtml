        <p>
        I wrote Tete in my limited spare time to do exactly what I needed it to do at the time.  Since
        then I've thought of ways to improve and extend the program.  Some of these ideas are listed here, in no
        particular order.  Feel free to comment on these, or suggest additional improvements on the
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=147629&atid=770351">sourceforge forums.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        I'm hoping to get to work on these ideas very soon, so keep checking back if you're waiting for
        something on the list - or jump on in, the waters lovely.
