        <h1>Tutorial</h1>
        <p>Here are some hints on how to get started...</p>
        <div class="liblink">
          <img alt="Tete's main screen" title="Tete's main screen" src="img/main.png" />
          <p>
          This is the main screen of Tete.  You can see down the left hand side the playback
          configuration.  This controls the instrument used to play the notes, the length of the
          sounded note and the delay to use to arpeggiate the note pattern.  It also controls
          the octave range used to play the notes.  The octaves are identified by their midi number
          which is less than intuitive, the octave containing middle C is highlighted.
          </p>
          <p>
          On the left you can see the selection controls.  Here you can select the type of pattern
          from intervals, chords, or scales.  You can also select within the pattern type to filter
          the type pattern that is played or appears in the tests.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="liblink">
          <img alt="Playing patterns in Tete" title="Playing patterns in Tete" src="img/playing.png" />
          <p>
          You can choose to only hear some of the patterns available by selecting from the list.  You
          do this by clicking while holding the control and shift key in the normal Windows manner.
          </p>
          <p>
          Tete will randomly play a sequence of patterns from those you have selected.  As each pattern
          is played it is highlighted to show you which one is being played.
          </p>
          <p>
          A good exercise in this mode is to set the arpeggio delay to a high value and then play your
          chosen patterns.  Once the pattern to be played has been highlighted and the root note played
          sing the next note out loud and see if you can get the correct next note.
        </div>
        <div class="liblink">
          <img alt="Running a test in Tete" title="Running a test in Tete" src="img/test.png" />
          <p>
          Once you're confident about recognising the list of patterns you've selected you can test
          yourself to see how well you're doing.  Tete will select and play a random sequence of
          pattern types form those you have selected and ask you to identify them.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="liblink">
          <img alt="Chords in Tete" title="Chords in Tete" src="img/chords.png" />
          <p>
          You can choose from a large number of chord types.  When I get around to adding more the
          list will get even longer.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="liblink">
          <img alt="Scales in Tete" title="Scales in Tete" src="img/scales.png" />
          <p>
          There are also a number of different scales to learn.
